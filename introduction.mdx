Welcome, let's learn how to use the new Pactto feature "Videos from your site", where users can send videos for you to review from your website, even if they don't have a free account with Pactto yet. No need to keep moving video files around anymore.

All you gotta do is add a couple of lines of code to your page, and you can start receiving videos from your users, to be reviewed by you on Pactto.

    Important: to use the feature, you need a Pactto Pro paid account (not a trial);
