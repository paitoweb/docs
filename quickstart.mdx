Please follow the steps below to add the right code to the right places in your site.

Copy the following JavaScript code and paste it after the opening `<body>` tag.
```html index.html
<script src="https://pactto.com/assets/js/embed_api.js"></script>
```

Copy the following JavaScript code and paste it before the closing `</body>` tag.
```html index.html
<script>
    window.pactto = window.pactto || {};
    window.pactto.coach = 'username';
    window.pactto.company = 'Coach Name';
</script>
```
Please make sure to update your Pactto username (e.g. 'ombe'), and the company name you want displayed in the flow (e.g. 'Ombe coaches').

Now just add the open function from any element in your site, such as a button, a banner, etc.
```html index.html
<button onclick="window.pactto.open()"></button>
```

That's it! Now your users will be able to send you videos up to 150MB each, and they will show up for you to review on Pactto. No more moving files around or creating complex upload flows for your beloved users.
